# Nextra Typescript Starter

[Nextra](https://nextra.site/) seems interesting as a site generation framework that works on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

However, its documentation isn't comprehensive on how to set up a starter example project, and even less so about how to do it with TypeScript as a foundation.

This template is the result of an afternoon of cobbling such an example together from various sources. What wasn't docs and trial and error was lifted from @phucbm's [NextJS starter template](https://github.com/phucbm/nextra-docs-starter) - thanks for your work!

I don't intend to actively maintain this example project, so please use this only as a reference. Always consult the official documentation for up-to-date information.
